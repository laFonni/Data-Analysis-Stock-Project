## 🧠 Project Overview

This project is divided into three main phases:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
2. **Feature Engineering**
3. **Modeling and Evaluation**

Each phase is documented in its own Jupyter Notebook.

## 🔍 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Load and clean historical stock price data  
- Visualize trends and volatility over time  
- Investigate statistical properties of features like Open, High, Low, Close, Volume  
- Identify seasonality or correlations between variables  

**Key tools:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

---

## ⚙️ 2. Feature Engineering

- Create lag features and moving averages  
- Generate momentum indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD)  
- Normalize or scale data for modeling  
- Split data into training and testing sets  

**Key tools:** `scikit-learn`, `NumPy`,  `pandas`

---

## 🤖 3. Modeling and Evaluation

- Apply regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)  
- Evaluate using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²  
- Visualize predictions vs. actuals  
- Optionally tune hyperparameters  

**Key tools:** `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`

---

## ✅ Results

- Visualization of model performance  
- Discussion of prediction quality and limitations  
- Suggestions for improving future forecasts  

---

## 🚀 Future Work

- Integrate more advanced models (e.g., LSTM for time series)  
- Pull real-time financial data  
- Deploy as a web app for live predictions
